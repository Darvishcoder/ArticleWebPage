<h3><center>Here are also some of the ways that social media can impact career goals </center></h3>

<ul class="content0">
    <li> Social media can help people explore different career options. By following people who work in different fields and seeing what their lives are like, people can get a better sense of what different careers are all about. This can help them narrow down their options and find a career that they’re passionate about.</li>
    <li>Social media can help people connect with people who can help them achieve their career goals. By connecting with people who work in their desired field, people can get advice, mentorship, and support. This can help them make progress towards their goals and achieve their dreams.</li>
    <li>Social media can help people build their professional brand. By sharing their work, expertise, and accomplishments on social media, people can build a reputation as an expert in their field. This can make them more attractive to potential employers and help them land their dream job.</li>
    <li>Social media can help people network with people in their field. By attending industry events, joining online communities, and connecting with people on social media, people can build relationships with people who can help them advance their careers.</li><br>
     On the other hand, social media can also be a distraction from our work. It's easy to get sucked into scrolling through our newsfeeds, and before we know it, we’ve wasted an hour or two.<br>

 And if we're not careful, social media can even damage our reputations. For example, a study by CareerBuilder found that 35% of employers have found negative information about a job applicant on social media.

   <h3><center>Here are some of the ways that social media can hurt your career </center></h3> 

<ul class="content1">
    <li>It can distract you from work. It's easy to get sucked into social media, and before you know it, you’ve wasted an hour scrolling through your feed. This can lead to missed deadlines, poor performance, and even job loss.</li>
    <li>It can damage your reputation. If you post something inappropriate or offensive on social media, it can be seen by your boss, coworkers, and potential employers. This can damage your reputation and make it difficult to get a job or advance in your career.</li>
    <li>It can lead to burnout. Constantly checking social media can be stressful and overwhelming. This can lead to burnout, which can impact your work performance and overall well-being.</li>
    <li>Oversharing personal information: Social media encourages users to share personal details and experiences, but oversharing can be detrimental to professional goals. Revealing too much personal information may lead to privacy breaches, potential identity theft, or misuse of personal data.</li>
    <li>Misinterpretation of content: Social media posts can be easily misinterpreted or taken out of context. A seemingly harmless comment or post can be misconstrued, leading to conflicts or misunderstandings with colleagues, clients, or employers. Such misunderstandings can have a negative impact on professional relationships</li>
    <li>Comparison and self-esteem issues: Social media often presents an idealized version of people’s lives and careers, which can lead to comparison and feelings of inadequacy. Constantly comparing oneself to others’ achievements or successes showcased on social media platforms may negatively impact self-esteem and confidence in pursuing career goals.</li>
